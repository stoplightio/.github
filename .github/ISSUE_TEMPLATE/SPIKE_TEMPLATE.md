<!--
Definition of a spike:
  "A task aimed at answering a question or gathering information, rather
  than at producing shippable product. Sometimes a user story is generated
  that cannot be well estimated until the development team does some actual
  work to resolve a technical question or a design problem. The solution is
  to create a “spike,” which is some work whose purpose is to provide the
  answer or solution."
